# Migration Helper for Hosts

This plugin can be used along side with temporary demos offered by Hosts. This plugin allows end users to request a migration from within the wp-admin panel.

## Tips

* If you have marked the plugin menu has "hidden" then you can retrive it via this relative URL `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=iwp_migration`
* If you enable `Redirection URL` in the settings page then it will redirect immediately after clicking on the Begin Migration button. Thank you screen will not come.
* Enabling `Show Domain Field` will add a new input field that will concat with the redirection url with this query parameter `?domain=<value of the input field>`
